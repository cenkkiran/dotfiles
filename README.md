## üîÑ Keeping Dotfiles Updated

### Export Current Settings

   ```

2. **VS Code extensions**:
   ```bash
   code --list-extensions > ~/.dotfiles/apps/vscode/extensions.txt
   ```

   ```bash
   cursor --list-extensions > ~/.dotfiles/apps/cursor/extensions.txt
   ```

4. **Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > ~/.dotfiles/requirements.txt
   ```

### Backup Current Configs

The installation script automatically backs up existing configurations to:
```
~/.dotfiles_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Homebrew installation fails**:
   - Make sure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Mac App Store apps don't install**:
   - Sign in to the App Store first
   - Some apps might have different IDs in different regions

3. **Permission errors**:
   - The script will ask for sudo password when needed
   - Make sure you have admin privileges

4. **Cursor configuration**:
   - Make sure Cursor is installed via Homebrew first
   - Extensions will be installed during the main installation process

### Manual Installation

If the automated script fails, you can run individual components:

```bash
# Install Homebrew packages only
./scripts/homebrew.sh

# Set up Python environment only  
./scripts/python.sh

# Create symlinks only
./scripts/symlinks.sh

# Set macOS preferences only
./scripts/defaults.sh
```

### macOS Defaults Customization

The `defaults.sh` script includes intelligent conflict resolution:
- Your current settings are always applied by default
- Alternative options are commented with explanations
- Look for `# CONFLICT:` markers to identify customization points
- Uncomment preferred alternatives before running the script

## üì± Applications Not in Homebrew

Some applications need to be installed manually:

- **Ghostty**: Download from official website
- **Grammarly Desktop**: Download from official website
